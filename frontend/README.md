# üñ•Ô∏è Frontend code
The frontend is a basic react app optimised and only properly working on a smartphone since it relies on swipe gestures. However, for local testing or development, switching the device mode to tablet or smartphone in the browser also works.
Navigation is handled through a slide-out side-panel, which can simply be slid out using a sliding gesture to the right side of the screen.

## Configuration
The following values can be configured in the frontend [.env](.env) file:
* **REACT_APP_BACKEND_IP**: defines the IP address of the backend. This should be localhost, if the backend and the frontend run on the same machine.
* **REACT_APP_READY_DERIVATION**: Maximum derivation of the temperature from the desired temperature for a ready status to show on the dashboard. (Defaults to 3¬∞C)
* **REACT_APP_OPTIMAL_DERIVATION**: Maximum derivation of the temperature from the desired temperature for a optimal status to show on the dashboard. (Defaults to 0.5¬∞C)
