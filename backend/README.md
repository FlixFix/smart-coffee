# ðŸ“€ Backend code
## Summary
The backend is based on a Node.js app, which serves an express http web client. It provides basic functionality for communicating with the pico such as a web socket for sending mqtt log messages to the frontend (For some reason I couldn't get a direct communication between the frontend and the mqtt broker to work, so I used this dirty work around).
Further, the backend handles the monitoring of the on-timer of the Rancilio Silvia and turns the machine of in case the set idle time is exceeded.


## The HTTP client
The included http client provides the following endpoints:
* **GET /coffee-hub/api/v1/pico-status**: returns a [pico-status-dto.ts](..%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fmodel%2Fpico-status-dto.ts) containing the current system time of the pico such as the status of all the connected devices.
* **GET /coffee-hub/api/v1/on-status**: returns a JSON object containing the current status of the machine based on the held on-timer of the backend.
* **GET /coffee-hub/api/v1/temperature**: returns a [temperature-dto.ts](..%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fmodel%2Ftemperature-dto.ts) containing the temperature of the main temperature sensor.
* **GET /coffee-hub/api/v1/reference-temperature**: returns a [temperature-dto.ts](..%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fmodel%2Ftemperature-dto.ts) containing the temperature of the reference temperature sensor.
* **GET /coffee-hub/api/v1/brew**: Starts the brewing process on the pico using the provided time by the query parameter as the brewing time.
* **PUT /coffee-hub/api/v1/devices**: Accepts a [device-status-dto.ts](..%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fmodel%2Fdevice-status-dto.ts) and sets the device's status on the pico accordingly. If the device is the main i/o connected device, this endpoint triggers the PID control on the pico.
* **PUT /coffee-hub/api/v1/pico-config**: Accepts a [pico-config-dto.ts](..%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fmodel%2Fpico-config-dto.ts), which sets the config on the pico respectively.
* **GET /coffee-hub/api/v1/clean**: Triggers the cleaning of the brew group on the pico, which basically runs the pump for the configured clean time in the [.env](.env), which defaults to 2 seconds.
* **PUT /coffee-hub/api/v1/config**: Accepts a [coffee-hub-config-dto.ts](..%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fmodel%2Fcoffee-hub-config-dto.ts), which holds the config for the backend, which is then stored in the [config.json](service%2Fconfig.json) of the backend.
* **GET /coffee-hub/api/v1/config**: Returns a [coffee-hub-config-dto.ts](..%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fmodel%2Fcoffee-hub-config-dto.ts), which holds the config for the backend, which is based on the stored [config.json](service%2Fconfig.json) of the backend.
* **DELETE /coffee-hub/api/v1/config**: Deletes the current [config.json](service%2Fconfig.json) of the backend, which makes the config fall back to the [default_config.json](service%2Fdefault_config.json).

## Configuration
The backend configuration is done through the [.env](.env). Following values can be configured:
* **PORT**: Which gives the backend port - default: 3001.
* **PICO_IP**: The IP address of the pico in the local network.
* **PICO_PORT**: The port of the web server served by the pico.
* **MQTT_BROKER_IP**: The IP address of the MQTT broker host.
* **MQTT_BROKER_PORT**: The port of the MQTT broker host.
* **MQTT_TOPIC**: The MQTT topic used for the application.
* **CLEAN_TIME**: The time used for the cleaning of the brew group.

## Logging
In case the MQTT broker is setup and the feature is activated on the PICO, every message received from the broker is logged by the backend in the [pico.log](log%2Fpico.log). The messages follow a custom log format, which is also included in this repository ([pico_custom_log_format.xml](..%2Fpico_custom_log_format.xml)) and can be imported into IntellJ in order to get colour coded and more manageable logs.
